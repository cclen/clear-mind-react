Assignment:
- Create a static slider component using HTML and CSS. Not looking for pixel perfection here â€“ just something workable that contains all the important elements, e.g. the slider "knob/thumb" and track, and the value labels (0 to 100).
- How do you design the layout?
- How do you opt to position the slider thumb and labels?
- How well would the implementation scale, size-wise? e.g. if you asked to increase the slider height by 100px, how much CSS would need to be updated to make sure everything was still positioned correctly?
- Add basic interactivity using JavaScript. At a minimum the user should be able to click on and drag the slider vertically.
- Use event listeners?
- Are the event listeners attached to the correct elements? What happens if the mouse moves outside of the slider element while dragging? Does it still work?

---- Bonus: ----
- constrain the slider so that the thumb cannot be dragged outside the track bounds.
- implement as a reusable component.
- how could the slider range and labels could be generated dynamically.
