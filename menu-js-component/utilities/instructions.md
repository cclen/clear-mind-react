Assignment: Building a website menu. 
Example: homedepot.com
Branch name: menu-js-component

Take a look at the Home Depot homepage. We’ll use the behavior under All Departments for our initial requirements. 
Again as with the slider, we will handcode the menu to begin with.

Tasks for you:

1. Come up with a context for a menu with main categories and subcategories. You can use the homedepot website, or create your own. Create the items for the main menu (top menu bar). This should be 6-8 items.
Identify submenus for just 2-3 of the main menu items. Submenus are items that open when you hover over one of the main items. They don’t need to be long lists, you can take the first 6 from homedepot, or come up with your own. Just have subcategories organized in a way that makes sense to you. 

2. Style your menu! Best to pick a style you like, and stick to that. You will notice it is easier to add categories later, too, if you don't need to worry about styling. You can pick a style from any website you wish to use for an example, or get creative and come up with your own. This is to exercise your UX eye - a good skill for any UI developer! The only requirement is that it should have a top bar, and items open the same way as on homedepot.com.

3. Behavior: onhover of menu item opens submenu items. On mouseout submenu closes. Some submenus may have additional levels of submenus. This is possible to do only with css, or you can write the js for it.

4. As a first coding step, write the html, css and js for the menus, and the open and close behavior. We will build on this in subsequent PRs.


Additional Requirement:
- the dropdown should open below the Main Menubar list item
